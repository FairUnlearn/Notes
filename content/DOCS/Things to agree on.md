How to read a paper: http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf

- Yellow `#ffd400` are default highlights
- Red `#ff6666` are things that I disagree with the author of the paper on
- Green `#5fb236` marks tasks such as references I want to follow up and read or tests I want to do
- Blue `#2ea8e5` highlights things that confuse me
- Purple `#a28ae5` are important conclusions

Check out the [SCTO system](https://github.com/lnilya/scto_obsidian). I use it in combination with the Obsidian PDF++ plugin and Zotero Integration with Better Bibtex.

I import the papers into Zotero, where they are renamed automatically with Better Bibtex (eg Smith-2024-paper name). Within Obsidian, I use the Zotero Integration plugin to create a Source note with all the metadata (authors, published date etc).

I read and annotate within Obsidian itself, highlighting in the PDF++ plugin and adding hyperlinked annotations. If you’ve used Mendeley before, this is a similar setup. I work in STEM and occasionally need to be able to quickly find highly specific information in a paper, so hyperlinked annotations help a lot.

I also have some Dataview queries to manage my vault.

-As for plugins, I use Better BibTeX, Better Notes, Ethereal Style, Translate for Zotero, and Zotero Reading List. All of these plugins have been updated for Zotero 7 compatibility.

Additionally, Zotero for Android is currently in testing and is also compatible with Zotero 7.


Depends on if you are using bunch of extensions for day to day work since not all extensions are supported yet for Zotero 7.

Your one page review should include the following: a one or two sentence summary of the paper. a deeper, more extensive outline of the main points of the paper, including for example assumptions made, arguments presented, data analyzed, and conclusions drawn. any limitations or extensions you see for the ideas in the paper. your opinion of the paper; primarily, the quality of the ideas and its potential


My two-cent: Step 1: Pick an AI field (any would do, like computer vision). Step 2: Take the 20 most cited papers from the last 10 years Step 3: Read all of them

The thing with research paper is that it’s all about depth. You don’t read these like a novel or a manual.

It’s 100% normal that you don’t understand everything that the authors are saying (they also may be wrong on some stuff).
