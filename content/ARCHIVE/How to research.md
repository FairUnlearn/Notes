How to read a paper

One trick I have is try prepping a half hour to 45 minute conference style talk about the content of the paper. If its a theory paper work through the proofs, try a few examples, implement the algorithm, etc. If its an engineering paper try implementing portions of it, think of some applications, etc. Above all else read slowly and figure out a way to file it so you can find it again later.

Also, DON'T ASK CHATGPT ABOUT THE PAPER.

I have seen it personally pull out references from nowhere and they sound extremely good. When checked though, I found that those papers either don't exist or what chatgpt told me was some weird amalgamation of multiple papers.

Â Zotero + Dropbox plugin to get it onto my Samsung Tablet
I use Kami chrome extension, so that each time I click on a PDF it opens in Kami. Then if I actually read it, I usually use the highlighter tool to highlight important bits and maybe scribble in the margins with the text tool. Now if I stop reading it, the annotations will be there the next time I open the PDF using the same link, which is nice. If I decide that the paper is important enough, I will click Upload to Drive, where I have a few folders by subject (usually renaming the paper as Author(s) - Title.pdf). Then if I *really* need to read it in detail, I will open up the PDF with Xodo PDF reader on my Galaxy Tab S3 and annotate more + scribble math etc with the S-Pen digitizer (which is awesome... I'm completely paperless). Another completely awesome app on Android is LectureNotes, where I have literally hundreds of pages of handwritten notes (math, diagrams, graphs, visualizations etc).


I personally wouldn't read and manage papers in Obsidian. Use a reference manager for that (like Zotero).

There are some plugins and ad-ons you can use to link Obsidian and Zotero if you're looking to make notes in Obsidian on papers in your Zotero library.


I have Zotero for all my papers in my lit review but I also make a note for each one in my Obsidian. I take notes on them/summarize/note things of interest in the note. I also include a basic citation and when I read it in the note as well. I essentially use Zotero as a library of papers read, to be read, etc. with the benefit of exporting citations easier if I need them but rely more on Obsidian.

I also have workflows for each dataset I'm using: background, how to access, relevant papers to it, etc. I have notes on meetings between me and my advisor, group meeting notes, class notes, proposal outline with links to the workflow and background of the datasets. Daily notes on progress and goals.

I work in glaciology and remote sensing using a bunch of datasets and drones. Keeping all of it in Obsidian keeps it organized and findable rather than scattered across bullet journals, notepads, and word/google docs (even if it's there I have a note of the thing and where it is: abstracts shared between me and my advisor for suggestions, posters for conferences, etc.)

Expect to spend several hours to read a paper.


Read critically: Reading a research paper must be a critical process. You should not assume that the authors are always correct. Instead, be suspicious.

If the authors attempt to solve a problem, are they solving the right problem? Are there simple solutions the authors do not seem to have considered? What are the limitations of the solution (including limitations the authors might not have noticed or clearly admitted)? Are the assumptions the authors make reasonable? Is the logic of the paper clear and justifiable, given the assumptions, or is there a flaw in the reasoning? If the authors present data, did they gather the right data to substantiate their argument, and did they appear to gather it in the correct manner? Did they interpret the data in a reasonable manner? Would other data be more compelling

Read creatively: Reading a paper critically is easy, in that it is always easier to tear something down than to build it up. Reading creatively involves harder, more positive thinking. What are the good ideas in this paper? Do these ideas have other applications or extensions that the authors might not have thought of? Can they be generalized further? Are there possible improvements that might make important practical differences? If you were going to start doing research from this paper, what would be the next thing you would d


. If you have questions or criticisms, write them down so you do not forget them. Underline key points the authors make. Mark the data that is most important or that appears questionable


After the first read-through, try to summarize the paper in one or two sentences

If possible, compare the paper to other work
